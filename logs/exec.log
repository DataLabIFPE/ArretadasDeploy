ERROR: for redis  UnixHTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=None): Read timed out. (read timeout=60)
An HTTP request took too long to complete. Retry with --verbose to obtain debug information.
If you encounter this issue regularly because of slow network conditions, consider setting COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT to a higher value (current value: 60).
